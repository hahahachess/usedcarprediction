Completed:
1) Data validation
2) Data cleansing and transformation
3) Fitted tree-based models such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines
4) Fitted two different neural network architecture models

To be done:

5) Deploy the best model as a tool for the public
6) Update the model by sourcing the latest dataset
